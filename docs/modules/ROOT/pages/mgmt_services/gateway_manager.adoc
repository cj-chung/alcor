NOTE: This document is under development

== Overview
The Gateway Manager is an Alcor microservice which manages the internal gateway and external gateway resources for a VPC.
The external gateways are responsible for forwarding traffic to/from external networks, such as another VPC, Internet, on-premise datacenter.
The external gateway including Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, VPN Gateway and Transit Gateway.
The internal gateway handles internal traffic within a VPC. Zeta Gateway is the only internal gateway in the current Gateway Manager.
Gateway Manager's responsibilities include but are not limited to create, update, delete, and search gateway resources for VPC.
It interacts with VPC Manager, Port Manager, Data Plane Manager, and Gateway Clusters.

== Service Requirements
[arabic]
. Manage different types of gateways for a VPC, including internal and external gateways, such as Zeta Gateway, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, VPN Gateway and Transit Gateway.
. Expose CURD APIs to register, update, query and delete VPC's gateway mappings.
. Define a health model, data schema and APIs for the health status of gateway resources.
. Working together with other services including VPC, Route, Port, Data Plane managers.
. Rollback is supported when CRUD operation occurs exception or the exceptions from gateway resources.

=== Key Workflow
We have two options here for VPC and gateway resource creation.
The major difference of these two option is in A1 and B1.
The VPC registration for gateway resource in A1 is going through DPM
while the same process in B1 is going through GM. Both A2 and B2 workflows are pretty much the same.
The detail workflows of two options are below:

*OPTION A*

==== A1. VPC and Zeta Gateway Creation
1. The benefit of A1: GM can be decoupled from major components of Alcor, we can consider GM is a non-major component.
2. The drawback of A1: DPM becomes a proactive component and it needs to update GM actively.

==== A2. Port Creation

*OPTION B*

==== B1. VPC and Zeta Gateway Creation
1. The benefit of B1: DPM becomes a passive component, it just needs to wait for the status update of gateway resources from GM.
GM is the major resource holder for gateway resources.

==== B2. Port Creation

*FINAL DECISION*
Option A has more benefit for managing gateway resources.
GM will become an important microservice in Alcor to manage all types of gateways in the future.
Therefore, Option A is the design choice for GM.
